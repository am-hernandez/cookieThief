# Cookie Thief!

Please, you must keep the robot from stealing all of the cookies! If you guess all of the letters in the secret phrase correctly you could put that robot into hibernation!

## Usage

When the game starts a random phrase will be chosen in secret. The objective is to guess the phrase one letter at a time. If you guess a letter that does not make up the secret phrase a cookie will be stolen by the robot... **don't let that happen!**\
If the robot steals all of the cookies you will lose the game and the greedy robot will win! Who knows what could happen after that!
